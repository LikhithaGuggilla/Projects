## Business Problem
Assessing whether 'a customer is trust-worthy or not?' is a time consuming, uncertain and risky task for most of the loan-lending organizations.

## Objective
This project's principal objective is to employ a machine learning model that accurately classifies a global finance company's customers into different credit score brackets ["High-Risk", "Low_Risk"] considering customer's personal, bank, credit-related information over years and help financial organizations make informed loan-lending decisions within no time.

-> **Machine Learning task:** Classification

-> **Data set dimensions:** 100,000 Records Ã— 27 column

-> **Target:** Categorical ['Credit risk']

-> **Tools Used:**
* JMP,Python - To conduct data analysis, data preprocessing and modeling
* Excel - To conduct data exploration
* Microsft Power Point - To present steps followed to choose a best model and explain it's business value

-> **Project Summary:**
* Following the SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) approach, comprehensive steps were implemented to optimize the efficacy of the analysis, which involved data cleaning,outlier analysis,feature engineering,principal component analysis(PCA),exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation and optimization. By employing and assessing the results of various models including Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Ensemble Models, K-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes, an impressive overall accuracy rate of 84.07% is attained.
* **The Best Model:**

## Business Value
* To mitigate the inherent risks associated with loan repayment, Decision Tree model recommends a strategic approach for businesses.By focusing on lending to the top 20% of customers identified as low risk, businesses substantially increase the likelihood of loan repayment. Our analysis indicates that this targeted strategy boosts the chances of successful repayment by 1.7 times compared to a broader customer base.
